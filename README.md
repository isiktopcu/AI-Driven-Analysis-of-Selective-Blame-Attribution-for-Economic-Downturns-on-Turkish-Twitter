Findings: 

Selective blame attribution plays a crucial role in the political landscape, especially during economic crises. In Turkey, this tendency may be a key factor in the persistence of incumbent parties.

Right-leaning individuals often deflect economic blame away from the government, attributing issues to external factors or the opposition. This protective behavior reinforces loyalty to the ruling party, even during economic downturns. On the other hand, left-leaning individuals are more likely to hold the government accountable, which could drive their desire for political change.

This dynamic of selective blame attribution helps sustain the support base for incumbents, particularly among right-leaning voters, and may explain the resilience of governing parties in Turkey despite economic challenges.
