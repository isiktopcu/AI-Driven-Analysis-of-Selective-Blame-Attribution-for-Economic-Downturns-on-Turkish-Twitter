Findings: 

In the context of Turkish Twitter, selective blame attribution could be a significant factor in how political narratives are shaped and how incumbent parties maintain their support during economic crises.

Right-leaning Twitter users in Turkey are more likely to deflect blame for economic problems onto external actors or the opposition, rather than holding the government responsible. This behavior helps protect their political alignment and strengthens their loyalty to the ruling party, even in the face of economic difficulties.

Conversely, left-leaning users are more prone to directly blame the government for economic failures, which could fuel a desire for political change. This selective attribution of blame helps incumbents, particularly those aligned with right-wing ideologies, to retain power by maintaining a loyal voter base that is less likely to hold them accountable for economic issues.

In this way, partisan bias in blame attribution on Turkish Twitter contributes to the political resilience of incumbent parties, even during times of economic hardship.
