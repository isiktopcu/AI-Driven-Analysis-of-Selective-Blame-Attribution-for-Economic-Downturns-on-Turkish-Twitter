Findings: 

The analysis of the difference in proportions of economic responsibility categories between right-leaning and left-leaning ideologies reveals a significant pattern of selective responsibility attribution, often characterized by blame-shifting. 

Right-leaning individuals are more likely to attribute economic issues to external actors or the opposition, thereby deflecting blame from the government, a behavior that reflects a tendency to protect their political alignment. In contrast, left-leaning individuals are more inclined to hold the government directly accountable for economic failures. 

This selective attribution and blame-shifting may influence electoral behavior, with right-leaning voters potentially exhibiting greater loyalty to incumbent parties during economic crises, contributing to the resilience of these parties. 

On the other hand, left-leaning voters, who assign responsibility to the government, may be more motivated to vote for political change. This dynamic highlights how partisan bias in economic responsibility attribution can reinforce political polarization and shape electoral outcomes.
