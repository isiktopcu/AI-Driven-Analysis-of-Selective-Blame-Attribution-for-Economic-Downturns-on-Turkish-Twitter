**Main Finding:**

**Right-leaning** Twitter users in Turkey often deflect economic blame from the government, attributing economic issues to external actors or the opposition. 

Conversely, **left-leaning** users are more likely to hold the government accountable, driving their desire for political change. 

This selective blame attribution reinforces loyalty to the ruling party, such as the AKP, even during economic challenges. 

By shifting blame away from the government, right-wing voters, a key part of the AKP’s base, struggle to attribute responsibility to the correct actors, thus continuing their support for AKP. 

This dynamic helps explain the AKP’s resilience and sustained political stability, even in the face of economic downturns.
